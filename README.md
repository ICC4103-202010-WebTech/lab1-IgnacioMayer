1- Describe the structure of the document

Describing the structure from the top, the first element is the opening tag for the html. Following this there is the Head, where the link, port and name of the website are written.  

Consequently, the body is programed. It seems that in this place elements are mainly visual and can become dynamic. An example of this is the tbody, a tag used to group the body content in an html table. In this element a lot of tr and td are programmed for structure the page in rows and columns for the table. In those elements in this website hyperlinks as well as aesthetics characteristics are given. Because of the tr element news different news are separately illustrated in this webpage. 

Analyzing, the files that this webpage use as source for functioning, we can see that there are different types of them, some are given with the tag  hn.js that contains a lot of functions which I presume works as the controller of page. Then another important sorce are those with the .css ending where mainly visual characteristics are described for this site.
